            Come to Royal Ridges for rest, relaxation, and a re-charge
            with Christ. We are a Christian retreat center operating
            on 390 acres in the scenic foothills of the Cascade
            Mountains. Located 20 minutes from Battle Ground, WA. for
            easy accessibility, but far enough for peace and quiet.
            Our retreat packages are perfect for small groups,
            including churches, schools, youth groups, Girl & Boy
            Scouts, women's and men's ministry groups, families, and
            more. Our facilities are ideal for a single-day event,
            overnight, weekend, or week-long getaways.
